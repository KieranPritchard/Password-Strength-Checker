## Project Description
### Objective
To build a project that enforces learning from a cyber security course I had done, specifically password security. Apply cyber-security based knowledge to a project, and start coding more cyber security based projects. 
### Technology and Tools Used
* **Language:** Python.
* **Tools:** Git, VS Code.
### Challenges Faced
Getting correct password strength values. My first solution was to set five variables to true/false based on what appears the password however, this proved to not work as expected. So then I came up with the solution I used in the code. it scans each letter in the password, then it chooses a value from one to five ands it to a list based on what type of character it is. The code then converts to a dictionary and then back to a list to remove duplicate answers.
### Outcome
I successfully created a project that applies cyber security knowledge, also allows me to show my experience and knowledge of password safety. I also got to apply and build my knowledge of python.
## How to Use the Project
1. **Clone The Repository:**
	* Download the project to your local device, this can be done with git.
2. **Run The Program:**
	* Navigate to the directory that the project is stored. 
	* Then run the script in the terminal.
3. **Input Your Password:**
	* When you run the program, you will see a prompt. 
	* Type in the password you want to check and hit enter.
4. **View The Password Strength:**
	* The program then analyses the password and display its strength.
	* Strength catagorys include:
		* "Very Weak"
		* "Weak"
		* "Moderate"
		* "Strong"
		* "Very Strong"
5. **Check Again:**
	* In order to check another password, all you have to do is run the program again.
